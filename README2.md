#Comments:

+ I started working on this repo the day after I recieved it. Hopefully I'm still honoring the 72 hour time limit!

+ I would have loved to use some React Components but I didn't have the time to get into that.

+ I'm currently leveling up my css skills. I know that I can improve quickly with that.

+ I have a few questions/comments on implemenation techniques.  I would love to discuss.

+ Working on this has been fun. Cheers.
